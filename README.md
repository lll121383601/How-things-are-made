# 3D scanning

## Description
The first task is to do a 3D scan. You can use your own device, or borrow the teacher's Revopoint pop2, an infrared-depth-map handheld scanner, to experiment with photogrammetry using mobile apps like "RealityScan" or "3DScanner App".
If your smartphone or tablet supports photogrammetric scanning apps and has stable internet connectivity, you can try "RealityScan" or "3D Scanner App". Remember to take multiple photos from all angles of your target object. During my class experience with Revopoint Pop2, I encountered unstable network conditions while scanning objects. In that case, I used Revopoint paired with a dual-axis turntable to scan a water cup in 3D.
PS: If you're using Revopoint like I am, be sure to download the Revo Scan app on your phone in advance.
## Documentation First, take the 3D scanner out of the box and assemble it as shown below.
Then, open Revo scan and connect the phone to Revopoint pop2 with a two-in-one data cable. After seeing the scanner camera screen and point cloud data on the home page of the app, the connection is successful.
Then find the matching dual-axis turntable in the accessory connection, and set the required turntable mode in the dual-axis turntable-advanced mode interface before exiting.
Finally, point Revopoint pop2 at the object, click the dot on the right side of the home page to start scanning, and start the dual-axis turntable. The scanning will end after the turntable has rotated for at least one week.
